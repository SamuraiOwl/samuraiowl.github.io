<h1>There have been some pretty big changes to this site!</h1>
<p>As I, Samurai Owl, learn about programming, I can make my website better and better. You may have noticed that things look different.<br>(Or you didn't because nobody cares...)<br>Anyway, with help from the folks at <a href="https://cubelabmedia.com" target="_blank">CubeLab Media,</a> I have been able to update the site's fonts to make it less...monotonous. I also removed the background, because it wasn't wrapping correctly. In addition, I fixed the Contact link and moved it to the bottom of the page.<br>The next things I hope to do with this site are...</p>
<ul><li>Optimize site for mobile</li><li>Choose a better background <em>for PC only</em></li><li>Make the background stay where it is while the rest of the site moves</li><li><strong>MAYBE</strong> make a header that you press a button and the links come up <em>(I don't know if that made any sense, but oh well)</em></li>
</ul>
<p>I will keep you all updated on the changes I make as I make them!</p>
