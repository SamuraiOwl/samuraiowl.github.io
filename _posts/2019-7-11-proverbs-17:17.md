<p>A true friend will be by your side through anything, good or bad. They won't abandon you or just tell you what to do and then leave. They'll be with you no matter what.</p>
<p>Jesus is our truest friend. He will never "leave you nor forsake you" (Deuteronomy 31:8). Not only will He never leave you in the dust, He lay down His life for us. He'd rather suffer and die on a cross than let you suffer and die in Hell.</p>
<p>Jesus is our truest friend. He is the most extraordinary friend anyone could have. He'll be there with you through anything that comes, and that makes Him our brother as well. We can lean on Him, no matter what comes.</p>
