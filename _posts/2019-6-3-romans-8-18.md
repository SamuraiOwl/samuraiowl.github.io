<p>We will face trials, challenges, tests, temptations, and hardships in life. It's unavoidable.</p>
<p>But no matter what we're going through, as long as we're Christians and stay true to the Lord, it'll all be worth it.</p>
<p>Being with God in Heaven will more than make up for our struggles. It will be worth every tear, every sleepless night, every drop of blood spilt.</p>
<p>We will face trials, challenges, tests, temptations, and hardships in life. That's still unavoidable.</p>
<p>But keep at it. Persevere. Stay true to God. Stay true to His Word.</p>
<h5>It will be worth it.</h5>
