<p>This is the second instalment in the 1ND13 G4M3R series (yes, I said SERIES)! Feel free to use this music in YouTube streams, video games, movies, whatever, as long as you give attribution and a link back to <a href="https://samuraiowl.bandcamp.com/album/1nd13-g4m3r-2">this album!</a></p>
<p>Alien Lawnmower is an…odd track. I found a weird instrument called “Alien Lawnmower,” put together a beat, and just took it from there! It was originally just me goofing around, but I actually liked the finished product so much that I decided to publish it!</p>

<p>I really liked Firelight for the ambient feel. It is very rich and full.
This track would be for a lava-y or firey or shadowy area (though you can use it for whatever you want to [see album description for details]).</p>

<p>So for Deep, I thought, since I already had a space-themed song and a fire-themed song, I thought I'd make an ocean-themed song. I played around with some stuff and requested divine inspiration...and here it is!! The epic finale to the second instalment in the 1ND13 G4M3R series!! (Yes, I said series.)
While making this song I kinda imagined it being in a video game -- specifically, the Roblox game <a href="https://www.roblox.com/games/35397735/Remastered-Scuba-Diving-at-Quill-Lake">Scuba Diving at Quill Lake</a> by <a href="https://www.roblox.com/users/1168878/profile">ColonelGraff.</a> Quill Lake has a lot of great music, enchanting landscapes, intriguing storylines, and overall just really awesome gameplay.</p>
