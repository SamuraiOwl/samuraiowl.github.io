<p>The fear of the Lord. What does the Bible mean when it says the "fear" of the Lord?</p>
<p>The fear of the Lord is more of an awe, or amazement at His power and the fact that He hasn't already snapped His fingers and destroyed the world.</p>
<p>It is the acknowledgement of His extreme superiority, of the huge gap between his power and ours.</p>
<p>If you fear the Lord in this way, He will teach you and guide you, allowing you to amass knowledge. Knowledge leads to understanding, and understanding leads to wisdom.</p>
<p>One last note: there is a fine line between a healthy fear of God and ridiculous fear of God. You don't want to fear him to the point of running from Him. That is the exact opposite of what He wants!</p>
