<p>Be careful what you let into your heart. It will change the way you act.</p>
<p>Don't let anything get in the way of your worship of God. That means, if there's anything in yoir heart that shouldn't be there, you mist purge it.</p>
<p>There are many things that could change the way you act. If it changes you negatively, then it will make it very hard to minister because you won't be acting the way you should be.</p>
