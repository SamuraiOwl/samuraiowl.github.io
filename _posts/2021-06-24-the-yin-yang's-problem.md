<h1>Houston, we have a problem!</h1>
<p>A little while back I was taking the final exam for logic class, and my buddy Simon was sitting behind me. He was getting frustrated because he was <i>trying</i> to think about the logic exam, but he kept having these profound thoughts every time he started getting somewhere and he'd go off on a mental tangent.</p>
<p>One of Simon's profound thoughts was a realization that completely breaks the whole idea of Yin-Yang: the simple truth of life and death.</p>
<p>Death comes only with life. If there was no life, there could be no death. Death is dependant on life. However, life is <i>not</i> dependant on death. Life could easily exist without death--in fact, it had to have at some point, regardless of your beliefs.</p>
<p>If you are, like me, a Christian, you believe that God created the world. He did not cause lots of death to create it. He simply spoke <i>life</i> into the world, or, in Adam's case, into an inanimate object.</p>
<p>If you are of another religion believing in gods, the gods were alive before there was death.</p>
<p>If you are an evolutionist, you believe that life came from non-life--not <i>death,</i> but the lack of life. The death I am referring to is the cessation of life, not the lack of life. There had to have been something alive before it could start to adapt and die and evolve.</p>
<p>No matter what you believe, you can go back to a first being or first beings. If you take it a step further back, you will not find death, but simply a lack of life.</p>
<p>If death is the cessation of life, there has to be life in order for life to cease. You see what I mean? Death is dependant on life, but life is not dependant on death, so life is superior to death. Therefore, they are not equal or in balance. And thus the problem for the Yin-Yang, which demands the perfect balance of all things.</p>
<p>This came from a kid in the middle of class! I thought it was pretty mind-blowing.</p>
