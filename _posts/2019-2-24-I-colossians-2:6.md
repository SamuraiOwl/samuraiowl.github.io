<p>Since we have accepted Christ, we should live like it. Don't just accept him and then just go off drinking and cursing and sinning all over the place. Act like you have Christ in your life! Show God's love to everyone you meet. Be kind and loving. If tou have Christ in your life, <h3>act like it!!!</h3></p>
<p>If you don't know Christ, now is the time to change. Find someone who does know Christ and ask them to help you come to know Him, too. And once you have Christ in you...</p>
<p><h2>Act Like It!</h2></p>
