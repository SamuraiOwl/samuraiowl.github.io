<p>Hi everybody, SamuraiOwl here. I've got some big (ish?) news! Today marks the release date of a new trailer for a W.I.P. book called Swordburst!</p>
<p>This book is sorta like Maze Runner in a way - you'll see how if you read the whole thing.</p>
<p>The name, Swordburst, was borrowed from a popular <a href = "https://roblox.com">Roblox</a> game of the same name. <a href = "https://www.roblox.com/games/181070986/Swordburst-Online">Swordburst Online</a> on Roblox was made by a guy known as <a href = "https://www.roblox.com/users/4402987/profile">AbstractAlex</a>.</p>
<p>But enough of this, here's the <a href = "https://samuraiowl.github.io/swordburst-trailer">link to the trailer!!!</a></p>
