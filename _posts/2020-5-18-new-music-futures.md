<h2>New Music Available Now!!</h2>
<p>I have a certain love for dubstep as well as a love of orchestral music, and a while back, I thought, How could I mix those two things together? Thus the fictitious (for now) band Phuturesynthony was born! It would be the world’s first-ever live dubstep orchestra! It would include:</p>
<p>• 1-2 Electric Cellos with Extra String for Bass Drops</p>
<p>• 1-2 Electric Violas with Extra String for Bass Drops</p>
<p>• 2-3 Electric Violins</p>
<p>• 4-5 Launchpads (electric, obviously)</p>
<p>• 1-2 Electric Pianos with Lots of Presets</p>
<p>• 1 Electric Drumset with Lots of Presets</p>
<p>• 1-3 Electric Guitars with Lots of Presets</p>
<p>• 1 Microphone (electric, of course) with Effects</p>
<p>For now, this band is, in fact, only a concept, but I very much hope to make it real someday. This is my attempt at making a theme song for Phuturesynthony, though I renamed it Future Synthony for the sake of readability.</p>
<p>This track begins with a simple piano and then some basic orchestral sounds, like a build-up. It sounds like a normal orchestra. Then, suddenly and almost without warning, the band members switch settings and go into synth mode, blowing the audience away! Wow!</p>
