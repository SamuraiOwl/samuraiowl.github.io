<p>How can you know if you can trust someone with something, especially if it's a big deal?</p>
<p>When you have a small, unimportant, maybe even mundane task, should you rush through it or do it thoroughly? I think you know the answer. If you do a thorough, good job on a boring task, then what are the odds you'll do a thorough, good job with a big, important, extraordinary task? Pretty good, eh?</p>
<p>In other words, always do your best no matter what. Colossians 3:23 NIV says, "Whatever you do, work at it with all your heart, as working for the Lord, not for men..." (<a href = "https://bible.com/bible/111/col.3.23.NIV">Read It on the Bible App</a>)</p>
<p>Do your best even in the boring tasks, and people will be able to trust you with large tasks.</p>
