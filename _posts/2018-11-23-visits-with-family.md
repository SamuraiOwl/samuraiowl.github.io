 <h1> Hello, Ohio! </h1>
 <p> Yay, Thanksgiving! A great time to head on it and visit family... even if they live six hours away in Ohio! </p>
 <p> I'm here with Lord Thaddius, Black_Hole50, GodzillasBaby and my mom. We've come all the way from Michigan to visit our family. Boy are we busy... </p>
 <p> Lunch with Aunt Dawn, dinner with Grandma Becki, and a visit with the Borcickys...all packed into Thursday(yesterday) afternoon! Today we're going out to eat with Grandpa Gifford and then to a movie with Grandma Kerry. Who knows what times brings?! </p>
 <p> Fortunately, I don't have to worry. I know that God has everything in control (and so does my mom). I can't wait to find out what adventures lie in store for us! </p>
 <h1> Happy Thanksgiving, Everybody!!! </h1>
