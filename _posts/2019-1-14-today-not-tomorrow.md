<h1>Tomorrow will Never Be Today.</h1>
<p>"I'll do it tomorrow."</p>
<p>This is a very common phrase. Another translation of it is, "Tomorrow, I will..."</p>
<p>Well, guess what?? TOMORROW WILL NEVER BE TODAY!!! If you always say you'll do X,Y and Z tomorrow, it's going to keep being tomorrow until you make it today!</p>
<p>My dad had a wallpaper that said this very well. On it, it said...</p>
<p>TOMORROW (NOUN)</p>
<p>The mystical land where 99% of all human work gets done.</p>
<p>Isn't that funny??!</p>
<p>Another thing to keep in mind is that if you do X,Y and Z now, you won't have to do it later.</p>
<p>Quit procrastinating!</p>
<p>Stop putting it off!</p>
<h2>Do it today, not tomorrow!!!</h2>
