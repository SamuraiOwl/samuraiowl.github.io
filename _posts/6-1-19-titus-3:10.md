<h3>As for a person who stirs up division, after warning him once and then twice, have nothing more to do with him...</h3>

<p>People can be annoying. As in, really, really annoying. There are some people out there who seem to live for causing trouble.</p>
<p>According to this verse, we should give these people a chance to change. When they start causing trouble, warn them. Let them know that whatever they're doing is not exactly the smartest thing to be doing. Do the same the secomd time. After the third time, accordimg to this verse, you should "have nothing more to do with them".
<p>Accordimg to another verse, we should not be."equally yoked" with those troublemakers around us (2 Corintians 6:14). We should give them a chance, but we should be careful that we influence them, not the other way around.</p>
<p>If you're trying to influence a person for Christ, and you notice that you're starting to sin the way they do, they're probably influencing you. That's not good. We've got to be careful who we interact with.</p>
<p>We should give those troublemakers a chance, but we should be careful that we influence them, not the other way around.</p>
