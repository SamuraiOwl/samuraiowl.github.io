<p>    God's glory is an amazing thing, and we need to share this with the world! God's glory is so incredibly awesome that the most any mortal man has seen of Him is His heel!</p>
<p>    We need to tell people about how amazing God is - and what better way to do this than telling them about the amazing things He's done? We need to testify to the people, because, according to thiss verse, we need to "declare...his works among all the peoples"! As humans and as Christians, our lives are some of God's works. We must tell the world about what He's done!</p>
