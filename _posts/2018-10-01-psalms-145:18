<h2><p>The Lord is near to all who call on him, to all who call on him in truth.</p>
<p>Psalms 145:18 (ESV)</p><h2>
<p> This is an awesome verse. It implies that God is always listening for us. When we need Him and call out to Him, He comes to our side. He really cares.</p>
<p> He is a loving God, not at all like many false gods, who might demand sacrifice or simply not fair</p>
<p> In fact, Christianity is one of the only, if not the only, religion that worships a loving God.</p>
<p> God is with you when you need Him! Do not worry. He is listening. He knows everything that's going on. When you cry out to him, He hears it, and He cares. He comes to your aid. He cares.</p>
<p> Don't ever forget that.</p>
