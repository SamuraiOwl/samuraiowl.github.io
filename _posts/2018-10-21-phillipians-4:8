<p><h3>Brothers and sisters, continue to think about what is good and worthy of praise. Think about what is true and honorable and right and pure and beautiful and respected.
Philippians 4:8 ERV</h3></p>

<p>Be careful what you think about! Good wants us to think about "what is good and worthy of praise" and "what is true and honorable and right and pure and beautiful and respected". Control your mind! It is a wonderful thing, but also wicked. Don't think about murdering someone when you're angry with them. Don't think about perverted things. Be careful with your brain, and control what you think about. </p>
