<p>Truth is something that many of us struggle with. We don't like telling the truth when it comes to "who stole the cookies". We don't want to tell the truth because we are afraid of the consequences. However, if we do tell the truth, we'll be set free from guilt. In my opinion, guilt is worse than the consequences of our mistakes.</p> 
<p>Tell the truth and be set free.</p>
