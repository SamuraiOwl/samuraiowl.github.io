<h3>No temptation has overtaken you that is not common to man. God is faithful, and he will not let you be tempted beyond your ability, but with the temptation he will also provide the way of escape, that you may be able to endure it.</h3>

<p>When you're feeling discouraged or unhappy or upset, or when you're having a hard time with something, remember; you're not alone. Someone's dealt with whatever you're feeling and overcame it. The name of that Someone is Jesus.</p>
<p>Jesus suffered immensely for us. He knows what you're going through, and He knows how it feels. He experienced it already. And He overcame it.</p>
<p>God won't give you more than you can handle, either, or at least not more than you can take.</p>
<p>A diamond is made thanks to extreme heat and pressure. When a diamond forms naturally, the temperature is above 2,000 degrees Fahrenheit and the pressure exceeds 725,000 pounds per square inch. That's over 37.5 tons of pressure.</p>
<p>When "the heat is on" or "the pressure is on", just know that God is using your struggling to make you something beautiful. And don't forget that Jesus felt what you're feeling - and overcame it.</p>
