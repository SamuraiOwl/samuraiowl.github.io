<h3>Now the Lord is the Spirit, and where the
Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom.</h3>
<h4>2 Corinthians 3:17 ESV</h4>

<p>What I find interesting about this is that
 when many non-Christians think of Christianity,
 they think of it as a set of stuffy rules meant
 to make life boring and monotonous. In reality,
 Christ is freedom!</p>
<p>People tjink they're free without God. They
 think that being a non-Christian means they can
 do whatever they want and be whatever they want.</p>
<p>But they're wrong.</p>
<p>We have to realise that no matter what we
 do, we are slaves to something. If you are a
 Christian, then you <i>are,</i> in fact, supposed
 to serve God. But if not, you are a slave to
 sin and the Enemy.</p>
<p>I dunno about y'all, but I'd much rather be
 a slave to a God of love and justice to the one
 whom the Bible describes as the "father of lies"
 and a lion seeking victims to devour.</p>
<p>Christ is freedom - freedom from the bondage
 and slavery of sin. We still have to serve God,
 but now we're no longer slaves - we are sons and
 daughters.</p>
