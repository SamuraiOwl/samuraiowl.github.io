<p>"Wolves prowling the streets of Oxford. A Green Man haunting the Highlands...Lewis Gillies is face to face with an ancient mystery."</p>
<p>Full of action and intrigue, Stephen Lawhead's epic trilogy titled Song of Albion is a great read, and one of my personal favourites, although the theology is a little skewed. I enjoyed immensely imagining how the scenes would look in a movie...and as we all know, any great movie has the accompanying great music.</p>
<p>So now here is a taste of the unofficial soundscore to Stephen Lawhead's Song of Albion Book One: The Paradise War!</p>
