<p>It is honestly very very veeery hard to do this. Love my enemies? Even when they're cussing at me or calling me nasty names? No thank you!</p>
<p>It's very easy to lose your temper when you're being forced to remember why your enemies are your enemies. It takes a patient and ridiculously strong-willed person to respond calmly and kindly to persecution.</p>
<p>When people bully you, it's imperative that you stop and think. Ask God to guide your next actions. Then think about what you are going to say and whether that is just going to escalate the situation. If the answer is no, then say what you wanted to say CALMLY AND RESPECTFULLY.</p>
<p>It takes practice, but eventually you will be able to "love your enemies".</p>
