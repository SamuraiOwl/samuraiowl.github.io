<h2> In my distress I called upon the Lord ; to my God I cried for help. From his temple he heard my voice, and my cry to him reached his ears. Then the earth reeled and rocked; the foundations also of the mountains trembled and quaked, because he was angry. He rescued me from my strong enemy and from those who hated me, for they were too mighty for me.
Psalms 18:6‭-‬7‭, ‬17 ESV</h2>

<p> Wow. Just...just wow.
 In this psalm, the writer is in distress, so he called out to the Lord.
 And God was angry! He was angry that the author was in distress! He was so angry that the entire earth trembled!
 And then God rescued the author from that which was distressing him.
 Good cares for us so much that He is upset when we are in distress. He is in unhappy when we are in pain.
 He wants to help us, to love us, to Father us.</p>
<p> To be with us.</p>
<p> "For I know the plans I have for you, declares the Lord.
 Plans to prosper you and not to harm you." </p>
