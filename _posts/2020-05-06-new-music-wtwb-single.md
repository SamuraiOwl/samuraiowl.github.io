<h2>New (?) Music Available Now!!</h2>
<p>This is an oldie. I made this last year and found it in my files today, so that's why I set it to being released last year.</p>
<p>I used some older instruments for this song, and it's not quite as good quality, but it's actually one of my better old songs.</p>
<p>I sort of tried to emulate the sound of the artist Glitch Mob in this song, but didn't manage it very well.</p>
