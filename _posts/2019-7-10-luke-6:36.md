<p>God is merciful. He shows grace when grace is undeserved, forgives the unforggivable, and loves the unlovable. So who's to say we shouldn't do the same?</p>
<p> 1 Peter 2:21 says, "To this you were called, because Christ suffered for you, leaving you an example, that you should follow in his steps." We should try to live like Jesus, and one way we can do that is by being merciful...even when mercy is ill-deserved.</p>
