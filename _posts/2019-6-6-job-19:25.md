<p>Jesus' death on the cross wasn't the end of the story. He did more than just die; He also rose again.</p>
<p>Jesus lives! As Christians, we know this to be true. "I know that my Redeemer lives," as this verse states. But it doesn't  there either.</p>
<p>Not only did Jesus die and rise again, He also conquered the Earth! One day, He will come again, and "at the last, He will stand upon the earth."</p>
<p>Onr day, He will reign supreme over everything, and He will defeat Satan once and for all.</p>
