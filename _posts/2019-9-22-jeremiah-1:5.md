<p>God knew who you would be before He even created you. He knew your future. He knew your entire existence. And He made you to spread His love and glory to the world.</p>
<p>God knows exactly what He wants you to be - a prophet. He wants you to be a witness, to spread the Gospel, to tell the world. "You will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes upon you, and you will be my witness in all Jerusalem, and Judea, and Samaria, and to the ends of the Earth." (Acts 1:8 NIV)</p>
<p>Be who you were born to be. Do what God made you to do.</p>
