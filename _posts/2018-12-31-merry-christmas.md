<h3> MERRY CHRISTMAS, EVERYBODY!</h3>
<p>The more, the merrier! Unfortunately, the "more" part didn't work out too well...</p>
<p>Christmas has come and gone without us seeing a single exteded-family member. Isn't that sad??</p>
<p>Oh well! It's not about who we see, now is it? It's about Jesus! Even so, we can still do special things for others.</p>
<p>For example, we put wool socks, an orange, a "Life Book" (Gospel tract) and a few other things in a shoebox, wrapped it all nice, and gave it to a random homeless person.</p>
<p>He seemed pretty happy.</p>
<p>What can YOU do for others this week to make them happy?</p>
