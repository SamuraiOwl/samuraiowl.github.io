<h3>I say this because I know the plans that I have for you.” This message is from the Lord. “I have good plans for you. I don’t plan to hurt you. I plan to give you hope and a good future.

<p>The problem with punishment and such is that we often don't realize that it is for our own good. We try to escape it and make excuses. We think punishment is horrible, torturous,  evil, painful, my-parents-hate-me devil work. Or at least, that's how I see it whenever I'm being punished. But really, it's not meant to harm us. It's meant to teach us. God punishes people too sometimes. But it's not meant to harm anyone. It's meant to teach them a lesson. It's meant to give them a better future then they would've had.</p>
