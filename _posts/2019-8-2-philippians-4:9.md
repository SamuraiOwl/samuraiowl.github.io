<h3>Whatever you have learned or received or heard from me, or seen in me—put it into practice. And the God of peace will be with you.</h3>

<p>This is another verse saying basically the same thing as James 1:22 ESV: "But be doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving yourselves." <a href = "https://bible.com/bible/59/jas.1.22.ESV">(Read it on the Bible App)</a>. We shouldn't just read the bible and be like "Yeah, okay, sure, I agree with that," and then walk away and not do what the Bible just told you to do! According to James 1:23‭-‬24 NIV, "anyone who listens to the word but does not do what it says is like someone who looks at his face in a mirror and, after looking at himself, goes away and immediately forgets what he looks like" <a href = "https://bible.com/bible/111/jas.1.23-24.NIV">(Read it on the Bible App)</a>.</p>

<p>We must do what the Bible tells us to do! There's more to it than just reading the Bible - we need to put it into practice! If we can do that, then "the God of peace will be with you".</p>

<p>Be more than just hearers of the word; be doers of the word!</p>
