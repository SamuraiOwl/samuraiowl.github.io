<h2>He cuts off every branch in me that bears no fruit, while every branch that does bear fruit he prunes  so that it will be even more fruitful.

<p>In another bible verse, Jesus is the vine, and we are the branches. So in this verse, the "branches" in question are us.</p>
<p>Basically, if we don't produce the Fruits of the Spirit (love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, gentleness, self-control) then we are false Christians and will be removed from Jesus. But if we DO produce these fruits, Christ will "cut" us. This may be painful when He "cuts" us, but by doing so, He puts us in a position to produce even more fruit.</p>
