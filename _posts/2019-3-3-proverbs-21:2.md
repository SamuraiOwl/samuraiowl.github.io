<h2>Every way of a man is right in his own eyes, but the Lord weighs the heart.
Proverbs 21:2 ESV</h2>

<p>Everyone comes up with ways to justify themselves.</p>
<p>"He started it."</p>
<p>"I didn't know."</p>
<p>"She told me to."</p>
<p>Everybody wants to believe that they are innocent. Nobody wants to admit they were wrong. We all want to be right.</p>
<p>No matter what we say or do, God knows if we were im the right or the wrong.</p>
<p>We may be able to convince ourselves and others that we are innocent, but God knows our hearts. He knows the truth.</p>
<p>He may punish us, and it may hurt, but He is our Heavenly Father. Parents punish their children to teach them. God punishes us for the same reason.</p>
<p>Also, trying to justify yourself is like lying to yourself. You're telling yourself that you were right even when you aren't </p>
<p>Instead of trying to justify yourself, admit it when you're wrong and ask forgiveness. Trust me. It's way easier.</p>
