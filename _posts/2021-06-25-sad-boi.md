<h2>Depression :(</h2>
<p>I want soo soooo soooooo badly to write dubstep but everything I write sounds like crap. I keep on trying and watching tutorials and experimenting and trying to replicate other artists for ideas, and nothing is working. It all sounds thin, wimpy, or just downright boooriiing.</p>
<p>On top of that, I have been working on a book for a while now. Get in the Game: Overworld is the first book in the series, and I'm now trying to write Get in the Game II: Otherworld. Same thing as with my music. Everything I write either drags, doesn't add to the story, sounds and feels like a duplicate of a previous chapter, or is just downright aweful. I'm praying God will heal me of this and inspire me to make cool stuff and give me the skill to actually make it, but in the meantime, it's super discouraging. I don't wanna give up because it goes against everything I know, but that's kinda what it feels like I'm gonna have to do.</p>
<p>I don't know how to respond to these emotions, or lack thereof. I have complete and total lack of motivation to do or care about anything. I don't know what to do, or if there even <i>is something</i> I can do.</p>
<h4>Guess I'll just have to suck it up and take it for now...</h4>
