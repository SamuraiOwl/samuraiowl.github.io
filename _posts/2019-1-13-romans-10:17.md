<p>Nobody's going to come ro Christ if they don't know about Him! We need to tell people about God if we want them to convert to Christianity. We also must remember that it isn't entirely because of us when someone does convert. We can only plant the seeds, and then God works in their hearts. We plant the seeds of faith, and God makes them grow.</p>
