<p>Becoming a Christian does not in any way mean that we are free of hardships. We will experience hardships as Christians - in fact, Satan will be targeting Christians because they follow Christ, so we will probably actually have more hardships as Christians than we would otherwise.</p>

<p>Fortunately for us, Someone has already overcome all of the hardships we may go through! That Someone is Jesus Christ, and because we are His followers, we can trust Him no matter what. Jesus may let us bend, but He won't let us break, even if we die. If we do die we'll just end up in Heaven anyways.</p>

<p>Don't expect life to be easy. Expect it to test you, but still remember that Jesus is with you every step of the way.</p>
