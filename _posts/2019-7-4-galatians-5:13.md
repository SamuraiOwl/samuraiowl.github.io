<h3>You, my brothers and sisters, were called to be free. But do not use your freedom to indulge the flesh ; rather, serve one another humbly in love.</h3>

<p>As Christians, we have freedom. Nothing we can do can separate us from God now.</p>
<p>However, that doesn't mean we get to sin whenever the heck we want to. Our freedom should give us the ability to live without worry. We can minister the Gospel in other countries and know that if we are killed, it's just all the better for us because we'll be woth God! "For me, to live is Christ and to die is gain." (Phillipians 1:21)</p>
<p>We shouldn't abuse our Christianity. We should use it to bring others to Christ, and we can do it without fear!</p>
