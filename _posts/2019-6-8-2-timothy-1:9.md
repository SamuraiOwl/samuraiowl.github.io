<h3>God saved us and called us to a holy calling, not because of our works but because of his own purpose and grace, which he gave us in Christ Jesus before the ages began...</h3>
<h4>2 Timothy 1:9 ESV</h4>

<p>When God's son, Jesus Christ, died and rose again, He freed us from our sins. In return, He asks that we follow Him. That means doing our best to live a holy life.</p>
<p>He didn't call us to do this because we're good at it. Oh, no. We aren't. He wants us to do this because He is loving, He is kind, and He wants to give us a second chance.</p>
<p>God is loving. He wants us to be with Him forever at the ends of our lives. So He gave up Jesus and asked us to follow Him with holy lives. He doesn't ask us to do it perfectly, because we can't.</p>
<p>He only asks us to do our best to live for Him.</p>
