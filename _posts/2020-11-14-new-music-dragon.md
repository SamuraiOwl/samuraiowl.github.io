<h2>New Music Available Now!!</h2>
<p>Dragons are my favourite fantasy creatures, partially because there is just so much to them. There are two main types of dragons: metallic and chromatic. Metallic dragons tend to be more good-aligned, while chromatic dragons are usually destructive.<br>There are 5 kinds of each type of dragon. The chromatics are red, blue, green, black, and white. The metallics are gold, silver, copper, bronze, and brass. If I was a dragon, I'd be a brass dragon.</p>
