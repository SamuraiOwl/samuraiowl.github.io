title : New Music - Taking Flight (Single)!!
published : true

<h2>New Music Available Now!!</h2>
<p>I have been thinking about owl-themed titles for songs and albums (because, after all, I am an owl). The words "Taking Flight" popped suddenly into my head...and the tune came with it! As it turns out, a good title often gives you an idea of how you want it to sound. The other major factor is divine inspiration.</p>
<p>Taking Flight has a very, very Irish sound to it, which I really like. I may remix it at some future date.</p>
