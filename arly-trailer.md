<h2>Arly - A Horror Story (Trailer)</h2>
<p> Arly Treshtin was a strange boy…and not in a good way.</p>
<p> He drew strange things…humans distorted beyond recognition, bloody scenes of war, and so on and so forth.</p>
<p> He said the strangest things. For example, a boy name Eugene Clim asked Arly to help him with his history paper. Arly’s response was, “Helpers feel excruciatingly intense urges to help. This I cannot forbear.”</p>
<p> Eugene never really understood what Arly meant by that.</p>
<p> Arly was indeed a strange boy on the outside…</p>
<p> But nobody knew the horrifying things that had happened to him in the past.</p>
