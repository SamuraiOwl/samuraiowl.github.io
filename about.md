<h1>Hello! My name is SamuraiOwl.</h1>

<p>I've just started learning how to make websites, and I'm learning Lua with Roblox Studio. I make <a href="https://samuraiowl.bandcamp.com" target="_blank">music</a> with <a href="https://lmms.io" target="_blank">LMMS</a> and use <a href="https://docs.google.com" target="_blank">Google Docs</a> to write my books. My favorite games include <a href="https://minecraft.net/en-us" target="_blank">Minecraft,</a> Terraria, <a href="https://roblox.com" target="_blank">Roblox</a> and <a href="http://www.playdead.com/games/limbo/" target="_blank">Limbo.</a></p>
<p>I dream of being a famous <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyK0IxH_ZJEcmXJOnN-iF3A" target="_blank">YouTuber</a> and of making a video game called Triple Dragon with a programming language called <a href="https://java.com/en/" target="_blank">Java.</a></p>
<p>I am currently using <a href="https://www.du-recorder.com" target="_blank">DU Recorder</a> to make <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyK0IxH_ZJEcmXJOnN-iF3A" target="_blank">gaming videos.</a></p>
<p>My first website was made with <a href="https://sites.google.com" target="_blank">Google Sites.</a> I don't update that site anymore since this is my official website now.</p>
<p>Well, that's all I have to say. See you later!</p>
