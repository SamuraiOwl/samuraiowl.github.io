<h1>Hello! My name is SamuraiOwl.</h1>

#### I've just started learning how to make websites, and I'm learning Lua with Roblox Studio. I make [music](https://samuraiowl.bandcamp.com) with [LMMS](https://lmms.io/) and use [Google Docs](https://docs.google.com) to write my [books](https://samuraiowl.github.io/books). My favorite games include [Minecraft](https://minecraft.net/en-us), [Terraria](http://terraria.org/), [Roblox](https://roblox.com), and [Limbo](http://www.playdead.com/games/limbo/).
#### I dream of being a famous [YouTuber](https://youtube.com/channel/UCyK0IxH_ZJEcmXJOnN-iF3A) and of making a video game called Triple Dragon with a programming language called [Java](https://java.com/en/).
#### I am currently using [DU Recorder](https://www.du-recorder.com) to make [gaming videos](https://samuraiowl.github.io/gaming_videos.html).
#### My first website was made with [Google Sites](https://sites.google.com). I don't update that site anymore since this is my official website now.
#### Well, that's all I have to say. See you later!
#### P.S. I also have a small Q&A  about myself [here](https://samuraiowl.github.io/q&a).
