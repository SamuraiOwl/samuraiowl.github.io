Hello! My name is SamuraiOwl. I've just started learning how to make websites, and I'm already learning JavaScript on [KhanAcademy](https://www.khanacademy.org/). I hope to then learn HTML/CSS and then Java, and then perhaps Python. I make [music](https://samuraiowl.github.io/music.html) with [LMMS](https://lmms.io/) and use [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/) to write my [books](https://samuraiowl.github.io/books). My favorite games include:
 [Minecraft](https://minecraft.net/en-us),
 [Terraria](http://terraria.org/), and
 [Limbo](http://www.playdead.com/games/limbo/).
 I dream of being a famous YouTuber and of making a video game called [Triple Dragon](https://samuraiowl.github.io/triple_dragon.github.io/) with [Java](https://java.com/en/).
 I am currently using DU Recorder (Available on Google Play) to make [gaming videos](samuraiowl.github.io/videos.html/gaming_videos.html).
 BTW, I have another site with all my stuff on it. [Go Here to Visit Now](https://sites.google.com/view/samuraiowl).
 Well, that's all I have to say. See you later!
