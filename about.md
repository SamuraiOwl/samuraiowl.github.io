<h1>Hello! My name is SamuraiOwl.</h1>

#### I've just started learning how to make websites, and I'm already learning JavaScript on [KhanAcademy](https://www.khanacademy.org/). I hope to then learn HTML/CSS and then Java, and then perhaps Python. I make music with [LMMS](https://lmms.io/) and use [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/) and [Google Docs](https://docs.google.com) to write my [books](https://samuraiowl.github.io/books). My favorite games include [Minecraft](https://minecraft.net/en-us), [Terraria](http://terraria.org/), and [Limbo](http://www.playdead.com/games/limbo/).
#### I dream of being a famous YouTuber and of making a video game called Triple Dragon with a programming language called [Java](https://java.com/en/).
#### I am currently using DU Recorder (Available on Google Play) to make [gaming videos](samuraiowl.github.io/videos.html/gaming_videos.html).
#### My first website was made with [Google Sites](https://sites.google.com). I don't update that site anymore since this is my official website now,  but you can still [check it out here](https://sites.google.com/view/samuraiowl).
#### Well, that's all I have to say. See you later!</p>
#### P.S. I also have a small Q&A  about myself [here](https://samuraiowl.github.io/q&a).
