<p>This is a game I was working on for a little while during a programming class at my church. I made it with <a href = "https://trinket.io">Trinket</a>. It's not very well-done, but it's a start...</p>

<h2><a href = "https://www.roblox.com/games/3279972425/Sword-Clash-Battle-Royale-Survival-ALPHA">Sword Clash : Battle Royale Survival (ALPHA)</a></h2>
<p>This is a <a href = "https://www.roblox.com">Roblox</a> game <a href = "https://www.roblox.com/users/949868877/profile">LordThaddius</a> and I have been working on. It's in Alpha, which means here are tons of bugs, and more maps coming. But we're impatient and want people to start playing, so here it is.</p>

<p>This is a <a href = "https://www.roblox.com">Roblox</a> game that I made a while back. Badly made, but it's a good start.</p>
