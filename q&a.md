<h2>How do you make your books?</h2>
<p>I use <a href = "https://docs.google.com">Google Docs</a> to make my books. However, I am currently focusing on music, so I won't be publishing any books any time soon.</p>

<h2>How do you make your music?</h2>
<p>I use a free PC program called LMMS to make my music. You can get it <a href = "https://lmms.io">here.</a></p>

<h2>How do you make your album covers?</h2>
<p>I use <a href="https://canva.com">Canva!</a> It's very starightforward and easy to use, and it produces quality covers (if you know what you're doing)!</p>

<h2>Where can I get your music?</h2>
<p>Thanks for asking! I recently started using BandCamp to publish my music, so my songs are now available to buy <a href="https://samuraiowl.bandcamp.com">here.</a></p>

<h2>How do you make your gaming videos?</h2>
<p>I use a free mobile app on my phone called <a href="https://www.du-recorder.com">DU Recorder.</a></p>

<h2>What about your stop-motion videos?</h2>
<p>For those, I use a different mobile app called <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cateater.stopmotionstudio">Stop-Motion Studio.</a></p>
