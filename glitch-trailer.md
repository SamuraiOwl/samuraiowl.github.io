<h2>Glitch (Trailer)</h2>
<p>“What do you mean, I can’t come in?!”</p>
<p>A boy stood at the gates of Heaven, which were shut tight.</p>
<p>There was an angel standing in front of the gates, guarding them.</p>
<p>“You can’t because you haven’t yet been tested,” the angel said.</p>
<p>“Tested? I’m guessing this isn’t going to be a pen and paper test.”</p>
<p>“That is correct. You will play a video game. You win, you get in. You lose, you
don’t respawn, you don’t get to try again. You lose, you go to Hell.”</p>
<p>“A video game?”</p>
<p>“Affirmative. It is a virtual reality. You will not remember anything from before you
started playing until you finish the game.”</p>
<p>“Sooo…where is the system?”</p>
<p>“Over here.”</p>
<p>The angel led the boy over to a hallway full of beams of light. In many beams
floated a person.</p>
<p>“How long have these people been playing?” the boy asked.</p>
<p>“Some have been playing for twelve years. Some have been playing for thirty. A
few have been playing for over a hundred years.”</p>
<p>“So not too long.”</p>
<p>“Affirmative. Here’s an empty beam: this can be yours.”</p>
<p>The boy stepped into the empty beam. A robotic voice floated out.
<p>“FINDING SERVER. SERVER FOUND. FINDING COUNTRY. COUNTRY
FOUND. FINDING STATE. STATE FOUND. FINDING CITY. CITY FOUND. FINDING
ADDRESS. ADDRESS FOUND.”</p>
<p>“Good luck,” the angel said.</p>
<p>“BEGIN GAME.”</p>
