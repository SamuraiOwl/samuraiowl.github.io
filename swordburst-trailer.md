<h2>Swordburst - Trailer </h2>
<p>    Ah, the forest! The sounds of birds singing, animals calling…</p>
<p>    And swords clashing.</p>
<p>    Two young male warriors with swords like silver needles battle in the forest. Back and forth, back and forth.</p>
<p>    One boy blocks, the other blocks. One blocks again, and the other blocks a second time.</p>
<p>    They push each other all over the place. Every once in a while, one of them gets pricked by the other’s sword.</p>
<p>    Then, one of them makes a fatal mistake. He decides to slash his opponent’s side. However, when he raises his sword, his opponent sees an opportunity and takes it. With one fluid motion, he passes his sword through the boy’s chest.</p>
<p>    His victim, stabbed through the heart, crumples to the ground. The remaining warrior cleans off the blade of his sword and marches away to find someone else to kill.</p>
