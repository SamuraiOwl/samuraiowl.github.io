<h2>Crypt (Trailer)</h2>
<p>Your eyes slowly blink open.</p>
<p>You’re in a small, black, cylindrical room, with lots of steam. There is one exit.</p>
<p>You step out of the small room and glance around.</p>
<p>In all directions, you see nothing but row after row after row of small, black, cylindrical rooms. You recognize them as cryopods.</p>
<p>There are vines and other plants blanketing everything.</p>
<p>You peer in through the tiny window of one of the cryopods. Through it, you see a young woman, frozen in time, lifeless.</p>
<p>You shudder and begin walking down the isles.</p>
<p>You walk.</p>
<p>And walk.</p>
<p>And walk.</p>
<p>For hours, you walk along a seemingly endless road, bordered by cryopods.</p>
<p>As time passes, the bodies inside the cryopods drive you near insanity. You begin to hallucinate, seeing eyes pop open and arms reach out.</p>
<p>You begin to run, getting closer and closer to insanity…</p>
<p>And an elevator.</p>
<p>That’s good, you think. At least I know this place isn’t endless.</p>
