<h2>Dragonblood (Trailer)</h2>
<p> Long ago, dragons ruled this land. They ruled the sky, the sea, and the forests. The humans of the land lived peacefully with the dragons…sort of. Some dragons, such as Cundoidu and Gonneilenth, demanded offerings from the humans. The humans eventually grew tired of being treated like slaves. They declared war against the dragons. The dragons were highly intelligent and had breath weapons, but the humans had fortresses, catapults, and other things that the dragons did not. Dragons were going extinct.</p>
<p> A brass dragon named Jiga realized this and knew that he would have to do something about it. He used his magic to transform into a human, and married a human girl named Loraraera. The child that they had the appearance of a human child, but he was really a dragon born in human form. This child grew up not knowing this, married, and had a dragon child. This continued for hundreds of years…and then, finally, one of the dragon people discovered his true identity.</p>
